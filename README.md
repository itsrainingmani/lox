# Getting Started

Welcome to the Lox programming language. I am following the *Crafting Interpreters* [book](http://craftinginterpreters.com/)

## Folder Structure

- `src\com\..\lox` : the folder that contains the source code for the lox language
- `src\com\..\tool`: the folder that contains other tooling to help with building the language. For ex., `GenerateAst.java` allows us to programmatically build a java file that implements Expressions.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default
